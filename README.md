# Project Overview

This repository contains analysis on customer data using both a CSV file and a Jupyter Notebook. The CSV file includes customer information, and the Jupyter Notebook performs data analysis on this dataset.

## Data Files

### 1. CSV File
- **File Name:** `csv file.csv`
- **Description:** Contains customer information with the following columns:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `Gender`: Gender of the customer
  - `Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and spending nature

#### Sample Data:
| CustomerID | Gender | Age | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score (1-100) |
|------------|--------|-----|--------------------|------------------------|
| 1          | Male   | 19  | 15                 | 39                     |
| 2          | Male   | 21  | 15                 | 81                     |
| 3          | Female | 20  | 16                 | 6                      |
| 4          | Female | 23  | 16                 | 77                     |
| 5          | Female | 31  | 17                 | 40                     |

### 2. Jupyter Notebook
- **File Name:** `ipynb file.ipynb`
- **Description:** Contains a detailed analysis of the customer data from the CSV file. The notebook includes the following sections:
  - Importing the necessary libraries
  - Loading and exploring the dataset
  - Performing data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Building and evaluating machine learning models (if applicable)
  - Visualizing the results

#### Notebook Structure:
- **Total Cells:** 70
- **First Cell:** Markdown cell with the text `### Importing the libraries`

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
